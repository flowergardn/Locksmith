# Locksmith 🔒

**Easily lock containers in Minecraft**
 
</div>

## How to use

### Crafting a key
Crafting only takes 1 iron ingot, and 1 stick.<br>

### Locking a container
To lock a container, simply hold the key, look at the container, and execute '/addlock'; adding a lock to the container, provided ~~you didn't somehow mess something up~~ no errors.

### Creating spare keys
Creating a spare key follows similar steps to creating a regular key, with one key difference; the use of '/setspare' over '/addlock', creating a substitute key for you to use a backup or to give to a teammate! And, you may be wondering, "hmm Astrid, is there a key limit?". No.
